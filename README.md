# Mini Blog

## 💻 Project
MiniBlog, project carried out by Professor Matheus Battisti's React course from [Hora de Codar](https://www.horadecodar.com.br/), which I was able to learn a lot about React. I also learned how to use various hooks like useMemo, useRef, useReducer, I also learned how to create custom hooks, in addition to using Firebase in the backend. [Click here](https://youtu.be/6WYq5CgbIE8) to see the project on YouTube.
